# Spam-Email-Classifier
# Spam Email Classifier using Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates a classic machine learning approach to text classification. It uses a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam) based on their text content.

## üöÄ Project Overview

* **Goal**: To build an effective model that can accurately identify spam emails.
* **Algorithm**: Multinomial Naive Bayes, a probabilistic algorithm that is highly effective for text classification tasks.
* **Feature Extraction**: Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert email text into numerical feature vectors that the model can understand.
* **Key Skills**: This project covers the complete machine learning workflow: data loading, text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

* **Libraries**:
    * Pandas (for data manipulation)
    * NLTK (for text preprocessing)
    * Scikit-learn (for the ML model and vectorizer)
